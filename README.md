Any good cybersecurity program needs the policies and plans to get it started and give it direction. This is our take on a starting point

## Rising tides lift all ships
Welcome to our Cybersecurity and IT Policy document. We believe in open-sourcing our work whenever possible, and this is no exception! Why hoard the work we’ve done when we can share it with the world, so you don’t have to rebuild it from scratch yourself?! 

This document is a few years old, so there may be people to credit that we have not explicitly called out. If you find we’re missing someone, please, please, please let us know so we can give them credit. 

Also, any copy/pasting should come from public domain works – like the US HUD, the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, and several universities. 

We are offering our work under the MIT license: permissive and free. Validate content for inherited licensing prior to use. Disclaimer: use at your own risk, no guarantees.

How to use this document:

- You MUST know the company first.

- Be judicious when defining change.
- If you haven’t created those other documents, we recommend creating them or removing the references to them.
- Remember that these are governing policies, not technical runbooks.
- Make sure you have HR, Legal, and anyone else important review this before you make it policy!
