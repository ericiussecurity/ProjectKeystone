Cybersecurity and IT Policy 
1)	Policy Statement 
a.	COMPANY shall adopt and follow well-defined and time-tested plans and procedures and layout cybersecurity objectives to meet business objectives and ensure continuity of operations and processes.  
2)	Purpose 
a.	The purpose of this policy is to establish cybersecurity guidelines that ensure our ability to accomplish our mission: [MISSION_STATEMENT].  
b.	Put another way; this program allows us to go to market and win by enabling us to create and capture more revenue, reducing cybersecurity risk, which reduces expected loss from damage to reputation and cost to recover. 
c.	This cybersecurity policy explains why we need to proactively steward information, technology, and people. We build and maintain our security program because it enables us to build trust, confidence, and goodwill within the market and with our teammates and partners. Further, we specifically outline the program standards to which we aspire and outline the processes by which we achieve those standards such that we can both capture more revenue in the market and reduce overall risk to the organization. 
3)	Scope 
a.	This policy applies to COMPANY, our employees, our applicable third parties, our technology use, our IT infrastructure, our computing resources, our networks, our information, and our data, and any of the above categories that we could be perceived as being stewards over. 
b.	The scope is limited by applicable legal and contractual obligations where required.  
4)	Enforcement and Expectation of Compliance 
a.	Any user or person bound to this policy that is found to have violated these policies may be subject to disciplinary action, including termination of employment, contract, or another arrangement.  
5)	Roles and responsibilities 
a.	You – As a COMPANY staff member or applicable third-party, you are an integral part of our security program. You maintain appropriate levels of access and privileges and defend the COMPANY with constant vigilance and discipline. You are required to keep the appropriate authorities informed of technology adds, changes, and reductions and report vulnerabilities and gaps. We cannot protect your needs if we are unaware that you have something you need us to protect.  
b.	CEO – The CEO is responsible for living cybersecurity fundamentals and setting the standard which empowers the team to drive the program. The CEO establishes priorities and goals for COMPANY, which the cybersecurity program and policies support.  
c.	CISO – The CISO leads the cybersecurity department and is responsible for reducing business risk through the judicious application of training, auditing, compliance, governance, and communication across COMPANY and is responsible for establishing all cybersecurity policies subordinate to this one, including but not limited to the policies attached to this policy as appendices. When applicable, the CISO receives policy and program guidance from the Head of Internal Audit. The CISO role may, from time to time, include third parties such as consultants or virtual CISOs.  
d.	Legal Counsel – COMPANY’s legal counsel provides a checkpoint for all security programs and ensures that areas such as data retention or emergency mode operations comply with legal and regulatory requirements. They are a primary stakeholder during some forms of incident response. They are the direct voice of the company between internal stakeholders, any government entity, and partner, client, or user communications. Often, the Legal Counsel works closely with the external (public) communications team during an incident. 
e.	Head of Internal Audit – The head of internal audit is responsible for establishing COMPANY’s top-level policies, including this policy, and for reviewing and ensuring the proper implementation of COMPANY’s top-level policies and all policies nested underneath them. 
f.	IT Team – Execute change in harmony with other stakeholders identified here to maintain the technical ability to execute company operations. Support the needs of COMPANY’s other staff, lead the change control process, and govern identity and access management through the organization. The IT team includes badged employees and contracted or third-party service providers who directly manage COMPANY’s assets and infrastructure.  
g.	Office Manager – Responsible for physical access management, key control, and daily security. The office manager coordinates responses to physical incidents and notifies cybersecurity and IT personnel. 
h.	Privileged Users – Users of COMPANY’s IT and computing assets with administrative or increased access and permissions. COMPANY places a high degree of trust and confidence in its privileged users because they have access to more information and resources than other users and can grant others access to information and resources.  
i.	Third-Party Stakeholders – People or entities outside the organization that require access to COMPANY’s information. Those stakeholders, as applicable, must sign proper authorizations such as non-disclosure agreements (NDAs/MNDAs), service agreements (SLAs, GLAs, etc.), and Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) when applicable before receiving privileged access. They are required to maintain the same levels of diligence to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information, systems, and resources.  
j.	See associated RACI Charts, process documents, and personnel documents that define roles and responsibilities more granularly here: [LINK_TO_RACI_DOCS] 
k.	Note: RACI stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consult, and Inform. RACI documents are used to outline who owns what portions of processes and how to process information is communicated.  
6)	Terms
a.	Asset – Including but limited to any intellectual property, information, data, physical or virtual property, equipment, software, service, or platform owned, operated, maintained or leased by COMPANY. In some contexts, this could include personal devices that have access to company assets.
7)	Policies 
a.	COMPANY’s Head of Internal Audit establishes this Cybersecurity and IT policy and delegates responsibility for all policies nested under it, such as the appendices attached herein.  
b.	COMPANY strives not just to comply with regulatory frameworks—such as PCI and GDPR where applicable—but to improve and sustain its operations and ability to serve clients and users through deliberate risk-management. To this extent, we have an ongoing cybersecurity and risk-management program and will continue to apply and mature it both in scope and in practice. 
c.	We will employ countermeasures that include but are not limited to: 
i.	Setting program standards 
ii.	Risk identification and classification  
iii.	Security training  
iv.	Identity management and identity-focused security 
v.	Change control  
vi.	Judicious use of the principle of least privilege (applied zero trust) 
vii.	A focus on SaaS-based applications  
viii.	Deliberate management of third-party risk 
ix.	Securing communications, data, information, infrastructure, systems, endpoints, and owned, leased, or open-sourced platforms.
x.	Out-of-band communications 
xi.	Information classification, retention, and disposal 
xii.	External audit, assessment, and testing when and where applicable (usually annually) 
xiii.	Asset, Vulnerability, and Patch Management 
xiv.	Incident Response and Incident Management 
xv.	Log and Event Management and Retention 
xvi.	Our strategy is simple. As Dustin Wilcox says: “Minimize the Attack Surface, Complicate Unauthorized Access, Rapidly Detect, Respond to, & Contain Incidents.” 
8)	Exceptions 
a.	Deviations from or exceptions from these policies shall be submitted to the CISO and IT Team for approval and documentation. 
b.	The CISO and IT Team maintain a repository of approved exemptions and associate risk here: [LINK_TO_EXCEPTIONS_REGISTRY]

Appendix A: Information Classification, Handling, and Retention Policy 
1)	OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE 
a.	COMPANY shall adopt and follow well-defined and time-tested plans and procedures to ensure that sensitive or critical information is classified correctly and handled according to COMPANY’s policies. The purpose of this policy is to help people understand what information may be used where and shared with whom and utilize that restriction to protect from unauthorized use and disclosure. This policy helps to facilitate how the COMPANY team identifies information to support routine disclosure and active dissemination of information, which also helps protect COMPANY’s intellectual property. 
b.	This allows COMPANY to maintain continuous business objectives properly steward information on behalf of relevant parties. 
c.	Information is considered a primary asset for COMPANY. COMPANY uses multiple types of information assets, and the sensitivity and handling requirements of these information assets may vary.  
2)	Scope 
a.	This policy applies to entities outlined in the Cybersecurity and IT Policy base document. Specifically, this document outlines information and data assets.
3)	Enforcement
a.	See enforcement clause in the Cybersecurity and IT Policy.
4)	Roles and Responsibilities 
a.	The CISO, DPLO, Head of Internal Audit, or equivalent person designated in writing is responsible for maintaining this policy in conjunction with appropriate other stakeholders such as the Legal Counsel. This role is accountable for proper implementation of the Information Classification and Handling Policy with various other department leads assuming responsibility for implementing the policy within their respective departments.  
5)	Acronyms 
a.	None for this policy 
6)	Policy 
a.	Privacy 
i.	This policy inherits its privacy from the base policy. Portions of this policy may, by exception, be held at a higher, more restrictive classification level and stored separately in accordance with access control policies as governed by that more restrictive classification level.
7)	Classification Categories 
a.	COMPANY categorizes information into three classes: Public, Internal, and Confidential.
i.	Public – Definition: Information or assets intended for disclosure to or interaction with the public or that, if disclosed, pose no risk or damage to COMPANY.
1.	Public information includes information assets that do not have any confidentiality or regulatory requirements, or that can be disseminated to the public.  
2.	Examples include press releases, annual financial reports in accordance with compliance, marketing material, social media, and COMPANY’s website. 
ii.	Internal – Definition: Information or assets that are not intended for public release but do not necessarily pose a significant risk or damage to COMPANY if released. 
1.	Internal information includes information necessary for the organization and operation of COMPANY that is not necessarily confidential or information that can be circulated freely within all offices or departments in COMPANY but not necessarily the public.  
2.	Examples include personnel assignments, office orders, internal circulars, movement of personnel or equipment, or invoices.  
iii.	Confidential – Definition: Information or assets that pertain to the specific needs of the project, team, department, or business process or that pose a significant risk or damage to COMPANY if improperly disclosed. 
1.	Confidential information includes information necessary for the business operations of departments or units, information that cannot be freely circulated within COMPANY, PII or PCI data, sensitive or proprietary information, and intellectual property that cannot be publicly disclosed except then directed by law, regulation, or legal order. Confidential information shall be restricted to need-to-know (an element of least privilege) such as those entities deeply associated with a project or business process. Access must be backed up and archived. It must be encrypted when transmitted or password-protected when encryption is not possible. It must also be backed up and archived when stored. 
2.	Examples include any information that would reduce COMPANY’s ability to go to market and win, such as business strategy, plans for mergers or acquisition, PCI data, personnel files, service or other agreements, or other techniques or procedures not appropriate for public release.
iv.	Confidential: Special, Related to XYZ: This is a sub-category of confidential that requires special handling potentially for client, compliance, or legal reasons outside of standard Confidential categories. Further definitions should be stored at a separate classification level than in this document.
8)	Secure handling of information assets 
a.	All information will be labeled according to its classification label in the header and footer of the document and clearly within the file name. In the case of physical storage media, it will be physically labeled with the highest level of information stored therein. 
b.	Some classification levels may require approval from the CISO, CEO, or legal counsel prior to transmission.  
c.	Restrict mailing and/or shipment of confidential information through only trusted mail services or couriers who must show authentication. 
d.	Store hard copy confidential information behind double lock and key. 
e.	Hard copy confidential information must be shredded at the end of life.  
f.	Take prudent cautions to prevent unauthorized personnel from accessing higher levels of restricted information.
g.	Limit access control both by role and by person/entity.
h.	Similarly treat confidential information as you would with both chains of custody and custodial responsibility. 
i.	Encrypt spooled data and validate user identity and permission prior to printing.
j.	Limit distribution to “need to know” and “need to use.” 
k.	Review persona and entity access monthly and at the end of major project phases.
l.	The approval authority for downgrading an information asset’s classification level resides with department leads, and when a classification level is in question, department leads are to consult with the owner of this policy, legal counsel, and or other executive stakeholders.  
m.	See associated charts, process documents, and controls more granularly here: [LINK_TO_INFO INVENTORY] 
9)	Classification by aggregation 
a.	Aggregating data and or information can change the classification level of that data. Converting data into information can change the classification of this newly created information asset. This is because information aggregation both represents an intellectual property base and can provide insights into the company’s internal workings that could cause the company to lose in a competitive market. 
b.	When information is aggregated, it will, at a minimum, be classified at the highest level amongst all the information aggregated. For example, when information of internal classification is aggregated with information of confidential classification, the aggregated information is controlled as CONFIDENTIAL.  
c.	If several items at the same classification level are aggregated, the aggregated information will instead be classified as one level higher than the information aggregated. For example, several pieces of internal information aggregated into one document will be controlled as confidential.

i.	Events and Incidents 
i.	COMPANY will use the following definitions of events and incidents following the definitions in NIST 800-61 rev 2: 
ii.	Event – Any observable occurrence in a system or network, such as a user requesting a web page or a firewall blocking a connection attempt.  
iii.	Adverse event – an event with a negative consequence like a system crash or unauthorized use of system privileges 
iv.	Incident – a violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices. This may include such actions as the threat of or actual use of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack or Distributed DoS (DDoS), or a user hosting illegal content on company resources.  
j.	Triage and Escalation 
i.	Not every event turns into an incident. When an event is reported, the first person in the reporting chain with authority to determine if an event meets the threshold of an incident must triage the event (or attempt to correlate seemingly unconnected events) and make a judgment or seek additional information. That person must then document their decision in the appropriate register for tracking.  
k.	Tracking and reports 
i.	When an incident occurs, COMPANY will assign the incident a category and track the incident in accordance with the process section of this appendix. When tracking or reporting, maintain the following information based on NIST 800-61 rev two and US-CERT Guidelines: 
1.	The incident category and tracking number 
2.	The assessed functional impact 
3.	The assessed information impacts 
4.	The date and time that the activity was detected and the date and time the activity occurred 
5.	The number of systems, records, or users impacted. 
6.	The network and physical location or identification of systems, records, or users impacted. 
7.	The points of contact for additional follow-up 
8.	The attack vector or root cause (as known/available) 
9.	The associated indicators of compromise, including signatures or detection measures developed in relationship to the incident 
10.	The actions taken to mitigate the incident and recommended actions the client undertake 
11.	Tracking is essential for reasons such as conducting post-mortem analyses, contributing to a lessons learned repository, identifying attack patterns that can expose insights about the team and the adversary. 
l.	Incident Categories - When categorizing incidents, use the following table: 
Category 	Name 	Description 	MTTR Goal (time from categorization) 
CAT A 	Simulations 	-Used to annotate incidents created to test systems and simulate attackers 	Not applicable

e.	If the event meets the standard of “Incident,” the authority triaging will use determine which specific members of the IRT need to convene and will use the PACE plan to contact them. The IRT will meet physically or virtually via a secure, out of band system, and determine a strategy: 
i.	Is this incident real or a false positive? 
ii.	Is the incident ongoing?
iii.	How does this impact our ability to go to market and win?
iv.	What is the business impact should the attack succeed? See Incident Categories 
v.	What assets are threatened and how critical is an immediate response? 
vi.	and Categories of Information Impact tables to understand the impact. Contact relevant people that may provide more information to severity.

Appendix E: Change Management and Change Control Policy
1)	Policy Statement
a.	This policy exists to ensure that we adequately plan for, document, react to, and learn from changes we make to our operating posture. 
2)	Purpose 
a.	The purpose of this policy is to ensure that information security increases our ability to win in the market and against our competition.  
3)	Definition 
a.	Change Management refers to a formal process for making changes to IT systems. The goal of change management is to increase awareness and understanding of proposed changes across an organization and ensure that all changes are made in a thoughtful way that minimizes negative impact to services and customers. 
4)	Scope 
a.	This policy applies to entities as outlined in the Cybersecurity and IT Policy base document.
b.	All Changes to IT services must follow a structured process to ensure appropriate planning and execution.
5)	Steps
a.	Planning: Plan the change, including the implementation design, schedule, communication plan, test plan, and roll back plan.
b.	Evaluation: Evaluate the change, identify the nature of the change and what assets could be impacted, quantify the impact of an outage to those assets, determine risk level, and select the appropriate change type and change process to use.
c.	Review: Review change plan with peers and/or Change Advisory Board as appropriate to the change type.
d.	Approval: Obtain approval of change by management or other appropriate change authority as determined by change type. Communication: Communicate about changes with the appropriate parties (targeted or organization-wide). For example, any change that could impact users must be communicated well in advance!
e.	Testing: Test proposed changes in a realistic environment and prepare for fallback or rollback procedures. Capture lessons learned and build runbooks where appropriate. The perfect example of a change that requires a runbook is for user-impacting changes. Build runbooks for the help desk to use to solve friction during rollout.
f.	Implementation: Implement the change while anticipating a need to fallback or revert in the event of an outage. For large system changes and for user-impacting changes, implement a phased rollout. For example, when rolling out multifactor authentication, test rollout with the security team first, and then a subset of privileged users, and then a subset of unprivileged users, and then by department. 
g.	Documentation: Document the change and any review and approval information. The documentation phase will include capturing feedback from the following:
i.	Departments or persons negatively impacted by the change
ii.	The teams responsible for rolling out the change
iii.	Stakeholders with significant investment into the change
iv.	Any emergency personnel or teams pulled in to aid the rollout
v.	Post-change review: Build the foundation that enables better, faster change in the future. 
vi.	This phase may be the most important phase of the change process.
vii.	This phase is designed to streamline further organizational change. 
viii.	This phase allows future change agents a platform to better understand the organization and infrastructure which enables them to build a better plan and avoid previous, known pitfalls.
6)	Authority 
a.	Department heads are responsible for the change management process within their department and responsible for coordinating and deconflicting with change outside their department. For measures that require additional funding, the department heads must consult Finance during the Approval step. 
7)	Documentation 
a.

b.	Data Loss Prevention Officer – COMPANY can either implement the DLPO role as an additional duty or align the role independently. The DLPO leads the subset of risk mitigation efforts to support the CISO and reduce risk to the partner ecosystem. The DLPO is charged with identifying various data across the organization and classifying it (Identify), building safeguards into the higher levels of data classification (Protect), implementing alarms to understand when that data has left the organization’s control (Detect), builds and leads the response to that data lose (Respond), and rebuild that data from backups and engage with stakeholders outside the organization when appropriate to limit the effects of that data loss (Recover). 
c.	IT Committee – Coordinate with the CISO and DLPO to provide input to the Technical Security Policies are appropriate. The IT Committee will serve at the Change Control Review Board and has a serious but not deterministic voice in controls applied at 49% of the vote versus the CISO. However, the IT Committee can veto projected per-user spend increase of 101% or greater. 
5)	Policy Overview 
a.	COMPANY will continuously work to decrease our attack surface and improve our security posture by applying the NIST fundamentals of Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover to the attack surface that we cannot decrease.  
b.	We will review both annually and as required by partners or other events such as but not limited to new legislation or otherwise our security compliance requirements. In the event that we have no formal requirement as outlined by local laws, we will apply minimum baselines as required by clients, customers, partners, suppliers, local laws and regulations, and reasonable prudence. 
c.	We know and understand that “getting hacked” is not a matter of IF, but WHEN. Therefore, we will ASSUME COMPROMISE. This means that we will take those actions that are expected of us throughout our stakeholder network to ensure that we can, on any given day, answer the questions as follows:  
i.	Have we been breached? 
ii.	Have we contained the breach? 
iii.	Do we have a duty to notify? 
iv.	Do we need to bring in an external incident response or legal team?

vi.	Did we lose anything? 
vii.	What actions do we need to take? 
viii.	What is the impact and scope of the breach? 
ix.	How long will it take us to recover? 
x.	If we ASSUME COMPROMISE, then we must continuously endeavor to IDENTIFY, PROTECT, DETECT, RESPOND, and be prepared to RECOVER.  
d.	Identify 
i.	We will continuously integrate our security team with our IT and logistics and operations teams to understand WHAT nodes (devices, infrastructure, software, instances, VPCs, SAAS, etc) are a part of our attack surface. We will use CIS Controls 1&2 to outline how we conduct inventory of those assets prior to bringing those assets into our attack surface and continue to develop our attack surface mapping following because if we know one thing it is that:  
ii.	“We cannot trust our inventory of assets because availability and adaptability often override confidentiality and integrity.” 
iii.	This means we must continue to place sensors to continuously, passively detect changes to our attack surface and actively scan annually externally unless required additionally by some other factor to understand how our attack surface may have changed without the knowledge or understanding of the security team. Often this is described as “Shadow IT.” 
e.	Protect 
i.	Understanding that modern systems often have some form of “Shared Responsibility Model” means that we have less control over some systems such as SAAS than we might with other systems such as internally developed and hosted applications run on company-owned hardware. However, operating within that understanding is not an excuse to assume risk. 
ii.	While we are strategically a SAAS-focused company, we will not assume that full responsibility aligns with the provider and we will apply reasonably prudent controls to protect our data and our people. We will apply such controls as multi-factor authentication, security review, vendor risk management programs, and best practices for password policies to limit risk exposure to data in transit, in process, and at rest. 
iii.	User endpoints will be hardened with preconfigured “gold images,” will be enrolled in company-controlled management programs (programs that balance security with personal privacy with preference focused on reasonable privacy), protected with multifactor authentication such as biometrics or other widely accepted factors, protected with increased defenses such as corporate-grade signature and behavioral analytics systems that block suspicious activity, allow-lists when possible, sandboxed email, and other zero-trust fundamentals such as restricted access. 
f.	Detect 
i.	Given that we are a SAAS-based, remote-focused company, our detection measures focus on endpoint, network, identity, and SAAS applications.  
ii.	Identity – COMPANY will implement a zero-trust model of security that focuses on Identity. That means that many of our detection efforts are focused on identity. Therefore, a large portion of our efforts are focused at the identity layer and we will continue to extend our identity integration into SAAS partners such as SalesForce, M365, and other supporting applications as required. This provides us visibility into identity areas that we might not have otherwise understood. This way we can understand where our data is, what our risk exposure is, what adversaries might be attempting to or actually accessing data from compromised identities, and what actions we need to take at the identity layer to limit exposure. Identity logs are pushed to the data aggregation solution to allow for both post-mortems, correlation, and hunt activities. 
iii.	Host (endpoint) - Given that we are a remote workforce, user endpoints are one of our weakest avenues.  We can never truly understand whom has access to those devices that might have company data on them. That means that any user that attempts to access company data must register the device with company management before accessing that data. This allows us to detect device health prior and therefore limit access to data for unhealthy devices. This is part of our MDM/UEM strategy. For runtime environments and/or daily operations on those devices, we deploy detection systems appropriate to the hardware and operating system that the user needs. Those detection systems such as host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) are often integrated into the same agents running some of the outcomes listed in the Prevent section above. Alerts can be pushed from those endpoints to admins and response teams. Endpoint logs are pushed to the data aggregation solution to allow for both post-mortems, correlation, and hunt activities. This is often done through Intune and the O365 Security Center. 
iv.	Network – For those instances when we do have an office, that office will have an employee and guest network. We will maintain appliances on that network and any remote access solution such as VPN to understand which devices are sending what data to whom. Logs from those appliances (both sensors, and network and security devices) are then pushed to the data aggregation solution to allow for both post-mortems, correlation, and hunt activities. 
v.	SAAS – While not all SAAS platforms have SAAS logs, we will ingest those logs that are appropriate into our data aggregation solution to allow for both post-mortems, correlation, and hunt activities. 
vi.	Log Aggregation Policy 
1.	Until we have a compliance framework that requires longer storage, we will store the logs that our aggregation appliance has ingested for 13 months. This number of 13 months is usually more than most regulations require but we’ve seen multiple times adversaries that are patient enough to wait 366 days to execute their actions because they know most companies shred logs at 365 days.
2.	Whenever possible we will “pre-compute” logs on the node before transmission to limit data volume and velocity into the aggregation solution. 
3.	Aggregation solutions need to not only have the capacity to support the incident questions outlined above such as, “Were we breached,” but also allow for correlation and hunt activity to help understand where data resides, where it moves, and what is happening to it.
4.	The timeframe here is used as a guiding principle and there may be exceptions under this non-exhaustive list: certain jurisdictions, compliance frameworks, and client contracts.
